PRIVACY NOTICE

Last updated July 15, 2023


This privacy notice for Oleksandr Dolhanenko ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and/or share ("process") your information when you use our services ("Services"), such as when you:
Download and use our mobile application (AvenEzer), or any other application of ours that links to this privacy notice
Engage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or events
Questions or concerns? Reading this privacy notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. If you still have any questions or concerns, please contact us at avenezer.app@gmail.com.

FOR ALL USERS:
We collect analytics on how you use the app. The analytics are anonymous. This helps us design the app in a way that fits our users.

FOR USERS WHO ARE NOT SIGNED IN:
The data you create within the app (life events, tags, etc.) remains only on your device - AvenEzer does not send it anywhere. You may use 3d party services like GoogleDrive backup, but AvenEzer will have no access to these copies stored online.

FOR SIGNED IN USERS:
The data you create within the app (life events, tags, etc.) is sent to the AvenEzer cloud so that you never loose your data. Other users will not have access to your events. Trusted high-level administrators have access, but do not read your events or share them with anyone.
 
  ACCOUNT TERMINATION:
  If you have an existing AvenEzer account, you may request an account termination at any point in time. Your data (events, tags, etc.) will be completely deleted from the cloud without the possibility to recover. To initiate the termination process, please contact our support team at avenezer.app@gmail.com
